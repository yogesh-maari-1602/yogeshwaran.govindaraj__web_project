Hi, I am Yogeshwaran from Krishnagiri. My mother works as a daily wage earner and my father is no more. I did my schooling at Vailankanni Matric Higher Secondary School. My inspiration is my brother. He always guides and motivates me. My goal is to become a Backend developer. I joined the Freshworks STS Software Academy because of my poor family situation. It has changed my lifestyle a lot. “Love your family, work super hard, live your passion.”
